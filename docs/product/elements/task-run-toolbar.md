# Task Run Toolbar

The toolbar is the only primary action row for a selected WorkTask. Stop is available for both `running` and `waiting_approval` so a task cannot get stuck while waiting for crew approval. Delete delegates to `TasksView`, which removes the matching scheduler row before removing the WorkTask.
