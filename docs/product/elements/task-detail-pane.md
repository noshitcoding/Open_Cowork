purpose: Edit the selected WorkTask and show its chat/project context.

sizeToken: task-detail-pane, task-context-strip, task-edit-grid, ui-field, ui-button, ui-badge

interactions: edit fields, choose workDir, create or open chat, run, stop, delete, schedule
dataSource: workTasksStore.updateTask; projectStore.projects through linked threadId; chatStore through task thread
accessibility: Detail section has aria label; form fields use labels; invalid working folder displays inline text and disables Start.
tests: TaskPanels.test.tsx
codeRefs: app/src/components/tasks/TaskDetailPane.tsx

rationale: WorkTask owns execution fields; project ownership remains resolved through chat-thread membership.

# Task Detail Pane

The detail pane is the editing surface for a selected WorkTask. It deliberately shows project context as read-only information.
